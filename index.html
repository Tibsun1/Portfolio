							<h3>Game Develop, Programmer</h3>
							<p>I’m committed to bringing people together with the power of multi player and cooperative experiences. Games and the communities that I have found through them have been tremendously positive in my life and I want to give back in any way that I can. 
							<br /> 
							<br /> I have a strong foundation working with C# and Unity and I'm looking to leverage my programming and problem solving skills to help bring unique and entertaining experiences to the gaming community.</p>

										<p style="text-align:left">
											I have spent the majority of my development time using Unity and C#. Here I have experience developing games from the ground up and I can leverage this experience to design game features and development tools that synergize with the game engine. This way development can be more intuitive for fellow programmers and game designers.
											<br />
											<br />
											Even though my strengths are in unity I have also explored Unreal Engine/C++ and Godot and found that many of the skills I learned in Unity are easily transferable. Additionally, recent advancements in AI have made learning new languages or new tools extrememly easy.

										<h2 class="major">Projects</h2>
										<p>
											I've worked with a few hobbyist teams on various projects in my journey. Fractured Alliance is my current and most developed project. Fractured Alliance is a competitive RTS inspired by the classics in the genre like Red Alert and Starcraft. We have a playable demo campaign mission and multiplayer skirmishes with two different factions.
											<br />
											<br />
											Unit controls and pathfinding have been my main focus on this project. The complexities of networking player actions while making units respond quickly, reliably, and predictably has been extremely challenging and rewarding. I've also had the opportunity to work on custom shaders and get familiar with HLSL in order to display the minimap and fog of war.
